Version 1 of the Knowledge Base API

Requirements:
- Embeddable content
- Basic handling of labels
- Must not give users access to content they shouldn't have

Options for Authz:
a) API keys have a mapping of operations they are allowed to do
   and spaces they are allowed to touch.  
b) API keys are simply a proxy for actual confluence accounts, 
   and the confluence accounts are assigned the permissions they need.

(a) limits what we can do and may not scale.  However, it does allow us to
    definitively distinguish between 404 and 403 for resources
(b) requires more manual setup and also may not scale, but is probably
    more correct.

Open-ended questions:
- How many users do we expect?
- Anonymous access?  Anonymous MIT-only access?

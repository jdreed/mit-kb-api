* Fix the hacky MIME-type stuff and possibly prefer html for browsers.

* ArticleLabels.put() is hacky, in that it fakes a 405 if not invoked
  correctly.

* Do we want to allow multiple names (multiple labels at once) in
  ArticleLabels.post()?  If so, what do we do if some labels fail to
  apply?  Return a list of those that did?

* Rate-limiting?

* Switch to wtforms, and remove the hacky path checking in 
dispatch_request/handle_error to better integrate with the admin interface

* Remove lingering aspects of db.session in admin.py

* better exception handling in admin.py
